		<h3>What sparked my interest...Meet Pam</h3>

		<p>
			Everyone in my town loves Pam! Regardless of whether you need a favor or a friend, Pam is always there to help everyone. And then, out of nowhere, Pam was diagnosed with Stage 3 Lobular Breast Cancer. The community that loved her so much wanted to help. We cooked meals and sent cards, but Pam needed help that we did not know how to provide. That made me think of Mili, an easily accessible online platform that could sensitively address Pam’s emotional concerns, her struggle to find healthy foods to eat, and the difficulty she had continuing to exercise. Mili could be the support that we all wished we could be.
