		<h3>What sparked my interest... Meet Talia</h3>

		<p> 
			When Talia was first diagnosed with migraine headaches at 16, a quick trip to the ER for a “Migraine Cocktail" IV broke the headache, and she was on her way. Over the years, her migraines have increased in both intensity and duration, and my fun-loving sister can be found sitting on the sidelines of the life she loves to live. Easy access to clinical studies being conducted to reduce migraine pain could greatly improve Talia's quality of life. This wish for my sister brought me to BuildClinical. I can only imagine the medical advancements that might occur as BuildClinical increases patients’ awareness and accessibility to clinical trials and helps doctors find required sample sets in order to conduct their research.
