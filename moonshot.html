    <h1>Access to Care Moonshot</h1>
    <!-- <h2>What is "Access to Care"?</h2> -->
    <p> 
        "Today, healthcare is for the few, for those who live near more developed cities or towns, and for those with money. Fully half of the world’s population goes without needed healthcare. Lack of access to quality healthcare is a problem affecting billions of people across diverse economies in every corner of the globe. Access to care is about geography – is it a four hour drive to the nearest hospital? But it’s also about being able to afford the care once you arrive. To solve the access problem we’re building radical new solutions that address delivery, cost, geography, and technology" - StartUp Health
