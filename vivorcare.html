		<h2>Need</h2>
    <p>
      This convergence of forces—growing cancer and survival rates, oncology shortages, and gaps in primary care training—lead directly to what we call the Survivorship Gap. And to solve the Survivorship Gap, we need new, innovative, and patient-centered models to deliver survivorship care, at scale, to tens of millions of survivors. So that they, too, do not fall into 'the gap'" – Hil Moss, VivorCare Co-Founder & CEO

		<h3>What sparked my interest...Meet Michelle</h3>
    <div class = "meet"> 
      <div class = "meet_overview"> 
		<p>
			When I was younger, I called Michelle my second mom. When I was in 5th grade, Michelle was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. It has been years since I cut off and donated my ponytail to support Michelle. I do not see her often anymore, but I do wonder how she is doing. I wonder if she worries about the cancer coming back. I have learned that cancer care continues long after diagnosis and remission. Thinking about Michelle brought me to VivorCare whose mission is to make care accessible to the millions of people like Michelle who survived Cancer.
